# Abstract

# Introduction

## Contributions

+ We propose generating corpora for fuzzing evaluation based on search-hampering features. The generation runs in an automatic manner, and the generated corpora are not only used for understanding and evaluating fuzzing but also helping improve the fuzzers based on the contexts of bugs.
+ We carry out a case study on AFLFast via a proof-of-concept corpus, called FEData. The corpus is generated based on three typical search-hampering features. The experimental results validates the utility of the feature-oriented orpus by showing its accurate conclusions in fuzzing evaluation.
+ We develop AFLFast+ according to AFLFast’s weakness that we expose in the case study. The experiments show that AFLFast+ can detect more bugs than AFLFast when other factors stay the same
